Marschak's Maxim suggests that we need to estimate the elasticity of labour supply with respect to wages, which, by the specification of utility is $\\frac{1}{1-\\rho}$. Hence, we only need to estimate the parameter $\\rho$ and the parameters $\\phi$ and $\\delta_k, \\forall k$ are redundant for this policy evaluation."

    "Now, suppose that we had cross-sectional data $\\{C_n, L_n, W_n \\}$, where $C_n$ if labour market earnings, $L_n$ is non-market time, and $W_n$ is the wage-rate, where the subscript $n$ denotes the individual. I doubt that such a model would provide a good laboratory in order to estimate the elasticity of labour supply, $\\frac{1}{1-\\rho}$. My main concern is that, in the data, I would expect to see \"bunching\" of $L_n$ since most workers will either be on full-time 40 hour a week contracts, or part-time contracts, such as 20 hours per week. If workers face a discrete choice in how many labour market hours to provide per week, rather than a continuous choice, I would expect that the estimate of $\\rho$ may just measure the average share of hours spent working, rather than the elasticity itself."

That is, such a regression would not be allowing for individuals to have different preferences over their optimal consumption-leisure bundle. Allowing for individual fixed effects, such as the above model augmentation, would be a more credible strategy. Lastly, labour market decisions are inherently dynamic, due to, for example, job search and human capital accumulation. Since this model is static, I would not consider it a suitable environment to consistently recover the elasticity of labour supply."
